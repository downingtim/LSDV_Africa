# LSDV_Africa

Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a member of the capripoxvirus (CPPV) genus of the Poxviridae family.
LSDV is a rapidly emerging, high consequence pathogen of cattle, recently spreading from Africa and
the Middle East into Europe and Asia. We have sequenced the whole genome of historical LSDV isolates
from the Pirbright Institute virus archive, and field isolates from recent disease outbreaks in Sri
Lanka, Mongolia, Nigeria and Ethiopia.
These genome sequences were compared to published genomes and classified into different subgroups.
Two subgroups contained vaccine or vaccine-like samples (“Neethling-like” clade 1.1 and “Kenya-like”
subgroup, clade 1.2.2).
One subgroup was associated with outbreaks of LSD in the Middle East/Europe (clade 1.2.1) and a
previously unreported subgroup originated from cases of LSD in west and central Africa (clade 1.2.3).
Isolates were also identified that contained a mix of genes from both wildtype and vaccine samples
(vaccine-like recombinants, grouped in clade 2)
Whole genome sequencing and analysis of LSDV strains isolated from different regions of Africa,
Europe and Asia have provided new knowledge of the drivers of LSDV emergence, and will inform future
disease control strategies. 

The code creates the (most of the) plots,
visualisations and graphics used in the paper.

Use "LSDV_phylogenies.Rmd" for the R code.

The other files correspond to alignment files, RAxML tree files and bootstrap files.
These are input for the Rmd file.
This allows creation of Figures 1, 2, S1, S2, S3 and S4.
